## Section 1: Dashboard Overview

### What is the Dashboard?

The **Apparatus Dashboard** is a **real-time control center** for security testing. It shows:
- 🎯 **Live attack campaigns** (Autopilot running against targets)
- 🛡️ **Defense mechanisms** (WAF rules, rate limiting, honeypots)
- 📊 **Traffic analysis** (requests, response times, errors)
- 🪝 **Webhooks** (captured and replayed)
- ⚙️ **Chaos experiments** (CPU/memory/network faults)
- 🎬 **Scenarios** (multi-step attack sequences)
- 🗺️ **Cluster monitoring** (distributed node status)
- 🎭 **Deception events** (honeypot interactions)

Think of it as **your war room dashboard** — everything happens here in real-time.

### The Layout

## Section 3: Navigating Consoles

### What Are Consoles?

Each **console** is a dedicated workspace for a specific feature:
- **Autopilot Console** → Launch and monitor attack campaigns
- **Defense Console** → Configure WAF rules and defenses
- **Traffic Console** → Real-time request monitoring
- **Webhooks Console** → Capture and replay webhooks
- **Chaos Console** → Trigger CPU/memory/network faults
- **Scenarios Console** → Build and run multi-step sequences
- **Cluster Console** → Monitor distributed nodes
- **Deception Console** → View honeypot interactions
- **Network Console** → DNS/TCP/connectivity testing
- **Settings Console** → Configure preferences
- **Overview** → Dashboard summary and status

### Opening Consoles

**Method 1: Click in Sidebar**
1. Look at the left sidebar
2. Find the console name (e.g., "Autopilot")
3. Click it
4. Main area switches to that console

**Method 2: Command Palette (Faster!)**
1. Press Cmd+K
2. Type console name (e.g., "autopilot")
3. Press Enter
4. Instantly jumps to that console

**Method 3: Direct URL**
Each console has a direct URL:
```
http://localhost:8090/dashboard/autopilot
http://localhost:8090/dashboard/defense
http://localhost:8090/dashboard/traffic
```

### Try It: Open Multiple Consoles

**Navigate between consoles:**
1. Open Autopilot (click sidebar or Cmd+K → autopilot)
2. Wait 2 seconds, notice it loads
3. Open Traffic (Cmd+K → traffic)
4. Back to Autopilot (Cmd+K → autopilot)

Notice how **console state is preserved** — when you return to Autopilot, your previous filters are still there.

### Console Parts (Standard Layout)

Every console has these elements:

## Section 10: Troubleshooting Dashboard Issues

### Dashboard Loads But Looks Broken

**Symptom:** Text misaligned, buttons in wrong places, layout broken

**Solution:**
1. Refresh the page: **F5** or **Cmd+R**
2. Wait 5 seconds for CSS to load
3. If still broken, clear browser cache: **Cmd+Shift+Delete** (Chrome)

---

### Real-Time Updates Not Working (Console Stuck)

**Symptom:** Autopilot running but console doesn't show new attacks

**Cause:** SSE (Server-Sent Events) connection not established

**Solution:**
1. Refresh page (F5)
2. Check browser console (F12) for errors
3. Verify Apparatus server is running:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8090/health
   ```
4. If server is down, restart it and refresh dashboard

---

### Command Palette Not Working

**Symptom:** Cmd+K doesn't open search box

**Cause:** Browser intercepted the keyboard shortcut

**Solution:**
1. Check if your browser or OS is using Cmd+K for something else
2. Try Ctrl+K instead (works on all platforms)
3. If still stuck, use the sidebar to navigate manually

---

### Export Button Missing or Grayed Out

**Symptom:** [EXPORT] button doesn't appear or is disabled

**Cause:** No data to export, or console doesn't support export

**Solution:**
1. Verify console has data (run an autopilot campaign first)
2. Check if console supports export (Autopilot, Traffic, Defense do)
3. Some consoles (Settings, Overview) don't export

---

### Slow Dashboard Performance

**Symptom:** Dashboard lags, clicking buttons takes 2+ seconds

**Cause:** Large data set (1000+ requests in Traffic) or slow network

**Solution:**
1. Clear old data: Click **[CLEAR]** button
2. Use filters to reduce displayed data
3. Increase auto-refresh interval (Settings → Auto-refresh)
4. Close other browser tabs to free memory
